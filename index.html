									<h2 class="major">Neon Echowave</h2>
									<p>In this <strong>2D cyberpunk-themed narrative</strong>, <strong>rhythm</strong>, <strong>driving</strong> game, I was challenged to work in 2D and effectively share my vision as a <strong>Product Owner</strong> and delegate work to my team of six, some of whom were in the office and others remote. 
									My tasks also involved setting up meetings and, to a degree, acting as a <strong>Scrum Master</strong> to ensure that a product was presentable within the few weeks we had. 
									</p>
									<p>Besides the management role, I was the sole designer for the game. I aimed to create a laid-back narrative-focused driving experience that interacted with a <strong>dynamic synthwave soundtrack</strong>, featuring a branching <strong>karma system</strong> for replayability and mini-hacks to diversify the experience between the two protagonists.

									<h2 class="major">Prototype Progress</h2>
									<p>My first project was not without its hiccups, and I gained firsthand experience in the <strong>challenges of taking on a management role</strong> and finding time to produce results when I rarely had time to sit for longer than an hour at my own desk.</p>

<p>However, I found being busy rather refreshing, as I constantly felt our work evolve further each day. <u><strong>Seeing the product take shape was a joy I took pride in, and it further excited me to continue.</u></strong></p>

									<h2 class="major">Side Projects</h2>
									<p> The works displayed to the right are what I created during the education at <strong>GameDev Indie</strong> after being introduced to the field.</p>
									<p> <strong>Most of them were created within a week</strong>, with the exception of the 3D Graphics. For that, I spent a week each on Sculpting, Topology, Rigging/Weight Painting, and Animation. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Level & Environmental Design</h2>
									<p> I was introduced to <strong>Unity's Terrain Tools</strong> and <strong>ProBuilder</strong> for basic <strong>grey boxing</strong> to establish a scene. <strong><u></p>
									<p>I am drawn by the allure of adventure</u></strong>, which is why I always strive to provide that experience. With the mountain scene in particular, I aimed to create a <strong>slice of an open world</strong> featuring a few points of interest <sup>POI</sup> that enhance not just the vistas but also awaken curiosity in the player as they traverse the grand valley.</p>

									<h2 class="major">3D Graphics</h2>
									<p> <strong>Weight Painting</strong> was particularly intriguing and quite finicky, especially since I <strong>challenged myself to create facial expressions</strong> without using <strong>shape keys</strong>, aiming to convey a lot of character through its face. </p>
									<p> I exclusively used <strong>Forward Kinematics</strong> <sup>FK</sup> due to my model's simple structure. Despite a tight deadline of one day per animation, I'm pleased with the outcomes. For smoother engine integration, I factored in <strong>animation blending</strong>, omitting some movements. For instance, I segmented the jump animation into three parts.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Pixel Art</h2>
									<p> <strong>Having never engaged with any type of art before</strong>, I was introduced to Pixel Art as an entry point. I found animation especially gratifying; once I got the pixels where I wanted them.</p>
									<p> <strong>I started playing around with sub-pixels</strong> and was intrigued by just how advanced it could get.</p>
									<p> Then, I proceeded to create a <strong>tilemap</strong>, setting up a scene with a few of my assets after experimenting with different styles.</p>

									<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
									<p>From a young age, video games have been a significant part of my life, a fascination ignited by my older brother. He introduced me to a new world, taking me on an unforgettable journey through the realms of <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>Tomb Raider</strong>, <strong>Warcraft</strong>, and <strong>Age of Mythology</strong>.</p>
									<p>These adventures sparked not just an interest but a deep passion for video games that has only grown over time after exploring hundreds of titles. This led me to seek out an understanding of how I could assist in the creation of future games.</p>
									<p>During my time at GameDev Indie, I dabbled in <strong>Programming</strong>, <strong>Pixel Art</strong> & <strong>3D Graphics</strong>, <strong>Animation</strong>, <strong>VFX</strong> and <strong>Game Audio</strong>, <strong>Game Design</strong>, <strong>Project Management</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> & <strong>UX</strong>.</p>
									<p>Today I'm excited to shape the future of gaming, embracing its evolving potential in entertainment.</p>
